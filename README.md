# ridecore-sqed-symbolic-start

Configuring SQED on RIDECORE with symbolic starting state.
Modified from the original [SQED demo](https://github.com/upscale-project/generic-sqed-demo).

Compatible with both Cadence JasperGold and Yosys.


## NOTE

Work in progress. We need constraints (not yet ready here) on the symbolic starting state...
